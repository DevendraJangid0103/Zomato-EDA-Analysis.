**🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**📌 Project Overview**

The Zomato Data Analysis Project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior, popular cuisines, restaurant ratings, and cost patterns across different cities.
This project showcases how raw data can be transformed into meaningful business insights using Python and visualization tools.

**🎯 Objective**

Understand market trends and customer preferences


Analyze restaurant performance based on location, cuisine, and price


Visualize key metrics like ratings, votes, cost, and delivery options


Gain insights useful for business strategy and decision-making




**🧠 Key Learnings**

✔️ Data Cleaning and handling missing values

✔️ Data Exploration and Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn

✔️ Identifying patterns, correlations, and insights

✔️ Drawing business conclusions from raw data

**🧰 Tech Stack & Tools**

Programming Language: Python 🐍

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

IDE: Jupyter Notebook




**📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps**

1️⃣ Data Cleaning – Removed duplicates, handled missing values

2️⃣ Feature Analysis – Studied cost, ratings, cuisines, votes

3️⃣ Visualization – Created plots to represent key trends

4️⃣ Insights Generation – Derived business-focused conclusions





**📈 Visualizations & Insights**

📍 Top Cities with maximum restaurants

📍 Most popular cuisines across regions

📍 Relationship between cost for two and ratings

📍 Impact of online delivery on ratings

📍 Distribution & correlation plots for better understanding




**🧾 Key Insights**

🔹 Cities like Bangalore and Delhi NCR dominate restaurant count

🔹 North Indian & Chinese cuisines are the most popular

🔹 Restaurants with online delivery usually have higher ratings

🔹 Mid-range restaurants receive more positive votes

🔹 Cuisine preferences vary by region, impacting cost & demand




**🚀 Future Scope**
